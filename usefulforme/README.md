diff.py compare two grounding files generated by the export_elements_to_txt function in grounder.py. It's a handy way to see what's changed between different versions or runs of your grounding process.

you can also include a third file that contains your generated plan. This is useful for checking whether every task, method, or action in your plan is reflected in the grounding files. I use it to ensure grounding improvements are on point.

We understand the importance of automated testing, but for now, we don want to spend too much time on test development.
